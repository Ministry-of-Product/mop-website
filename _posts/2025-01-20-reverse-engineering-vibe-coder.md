# Reverse Engineering a Product from a "Vibe Coder" Solution

## The Challenge

A marketing expert had used a no-code / generative platform to build the tool she had always wanted. The product worked—until it didn't. The system was fragile, naming conventions had drifted, and two divergent versions of the codebase had emerged.

She had validated the idea, but not the engineering.

## The Approach

We treated the existing application as a prototype and source of truth for intent—not implementation. Together, we clarified what the system needed to do and why, then used the existing codebase as a reference point rather than a foundation.

I regenerated the system using proper system-level design, clear naming, and automated testing. The result was a clean, stable architecture that preserved the original vision while removing the brittleness.

We then deployed the application on a cloud provider with security, data integrity, and future growth in mind.

## The Outcome

The client now has a production-grade application that is stable, secure, and easy to extend. New features are straightforward to add, and there's confidence that the system won't collapse under real usage. The idea stayed the same—the foundation is now solid.
