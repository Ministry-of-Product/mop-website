# Helping a Team Understand the Bigger Picture

## The Challenge

A client was building a highly advanced system that used AI to process documents and generate new insights. The technology was strong—but it wasn't yet clear where this product fit, or how to articulate the category it belonged to.

## The Approach

My role was to step back and widen the lens.

I built a spidering system that ingested podcast transcripts and RSS feeds across the industry, creating a structured data repository. We then used large language models to enrich that data—extracting themes, trends, and signals—and to quantify the markets different players were addressing.

Through several iterations, patterns emerged. We could see where incumbents clustered, where gaps existed, and what this system uniquely enabled.

## The Outcome

The client gained clarity on the market landscape and was able to define the category their product was pioneering. This shifted the conversation from "what does this system do?" to "why this category exists and why we lead it."
