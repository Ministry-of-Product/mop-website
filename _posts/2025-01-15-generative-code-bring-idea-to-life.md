# Using Generative Code to Bring an Idea to Life

## The Challenge

A seasoned PR professional wanted to turn 25 years of hard-won experience into a scalable AI-powered tool. They had a refined process for building PR campaigns, but translating that tacit knowledge into software felt overwhelming.

## The Approach

We began with a single, focused one-hour conversation. That session was enough to extract the core workflow, decision points, and real-world use cases behind their process.

Using generative code techniques, I translated that knowledge directly into a working application—without months of documentation or discovery. At the next meeting, the client reviewed a live product and received immediate access.

We ran two tight feedback iterations, refining behavior and structure until the tool accurately reflected their expertise. At that point, the requirements weren't just documented—they were proven in running software.

## The Outcome

In a matter of weeks, the client had a functioning AI-driven product that captured decades of experience and could be extended, tested, and scaled. What had lived only in their head was now a concrete system they could build a business around.
