# Ministry of Product — Website Update Spec

This document defines the **information architecture, content intent, and blog scope** for the Ministry of Product website. It is designed to attract clients who already have revenue, clients, and leverage — and are looking to scale their business safely and correctly using AI-enabled systems.

This is a **content and positioning spec**, not finished copy.

---

## Core Positioning

**Ministry of Product helps experienced operators turn existing business leverage into AI-enabled systems — without scaling the wrong thing first.**

Key beliefs embedded across the site:
- The biggest risk is not technical failure, but **bad sequencing**
- AI should scale judgment and strategy, not noise
- Early systems should be treated as experiments, not commitments
- Saying *no* is often the highest-leverage move

The site is intentionally opinionated and selective. It prioritizes clarity, restraint, and decision quality over volume or hype.

---

## Target Audience

The site is for:
- Businesses with **existing revenue, clients, and authority**
- Founders or operators trying to scale strategy, insight, or operations with AI
- Teams overwhelmed by possibilities rather than blocked by capability

The site is **not** for:
- Idea-only founders
- People afraid of ideas being “stolen”
- Vendor shoppers or tire-kickers
- Teams without budget or decision-making authority
- People looking for free work, demos, or speculative effort

The goal is usefulness, not scale.
