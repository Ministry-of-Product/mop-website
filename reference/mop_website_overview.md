# Website Overview

## Purpose
This website exists to help AI builders, solo founders, and small teams make **better next-step decisions**.  
Not more features. Not more demos. Better judgment about what to do *now*.

The core value is clarity:
- What matters next
- What does *not* matter yet
- Where effort will compound vs. stall

The site combines **real-world examples**, **opinionated analysis**, and **direct guidance**.

---

## Language & Tone

**Principles**
- Plainspoken, not academic
- Opinionated, not preachy
- Calm, confident, and grounded in reality
- Focused on decisions, tradeoffs, and sequencing

**What we avoid**
- Hype (“revolutionary”, “game-changing”)
- Hustle language (“grind”, “10x”, “move fast or die”)
- Over-technical explanations without context
- Motivational fluff

**What we emphasize**
- Judgment over tools
- Progress over polish
- Learning over ego
- Reality over theory

---

## Primary Audience

- People who have *already built something* with AI
- Solo builders, product-minded engineers, early founders
- Technically capable but directionally uncertain
- Not beginners, not enterprise committees

If someone is asking:
> “I’ve built this… now what?”

They are in the right place.

---

## Value Proposition

Most AI products don’t fail because the tech is bad.  
They fail because the **sequence of decisions is wrong**.

This site helps people:
- Avoid wasting months on the wrong next step
- Recognize when to narrow vs. expand
- Decide whether something is a feature, product, or company
- Move ideas into contact with reality faster

The value is **decision quality**, not output volume.

## Sitemap

### 1. Home
**Goal:** Establish trust and framing

Key elements:
- Clear positioning: decision clarity for AI builders
- Short explanation of the problem (people get stuck after building)
- Introduction to the approach
- Entry points to:
  - Always Be Launching (ABL)
  - Advisory / guidance

---

### 2. Always Be Launching (ABL)
**Goal:** Demonstrate judgment through real examples

This is a recurring content series (blog + video).  
It is not generic AI content.

Each piece focuses on:
- What someone built
- Where they got stuck

- What should have happened next

(Defined in detail below)

---

### 3. Advisory / Guidance
**Goal:** Convert trust into engagement

Explains:
- Who this is for

- What problems it’s designed to solve
- How to get started

No hard sell.  
Emphasis on fit and usefulness.

---

### 4. About
**Goal:** Establish credibility and intent

Focus on:
- How you think
- Why judgment matters
- Your bias toward clarity and restraint
- Your experience across product, data, and systems

Not a résumé.  
A perspective statement.

---

### 5. Manifesto (Optional but recommended)
**Goal:** Filter the audience

Short, opinionated statements such as:
- Launches are experiments, not commitments
- Progress requires exposure to reality
- Most products fail from bad sequencing, not bad ideas
- Clarity beats speed
- Learning is the only real metric early on

---

## Always Be Launching (ABL)

### Definition

**Always Be Launching** does *not* mean shipping constantly.

It means:
> Continuously moving ideas, assumptions, and decisions into contact with reality.

A launch can be:
- A conversation
- A landing page
- A pricing test
- A demo shown to one person
- Killing a feature
- Narrowing the audience

The goal is learning, not noise.

---

### ABL Content Structure

Each ABL entry follows a consistent pattern:

1. **What They Built**
   - Short, concrete description
   - No hype

2. **The Original Assumption**
   - What they believed would matter
   - Why it made sense at the time

3. **Where They Got Stuck**
   - The decision gap
   - The moment progress slowed

4. **The Decision That Mattered**
   - What actually moved things forward (or would have)

5. **What Should Happen Next**
   - Opinionated guidance
   - Clear tradeoffs
   - No false certainty

6. **Pattern Tags**
   Examples:
   - Prototype trap
   - Premature SaaS
   - Feature vs product
   - No clear user
   - Overbuilt too early

---

### Role of ABL on the Site

ABL serves three purposes:
1. Education — showing how progress *actually* happens
2. Pattern recognition — helping readers see themselves
3. Trust — demonstrating real judgment, not theory

ABL is the **engine**, not the product.

## Success Criteria

This website is successful if:
- Readers say “this explains what I’m dealing with”
- Builders change what they do *next*
- Fewer people waste time building the wrong thing
- Conversations start from clarity, not confusion

The goal is not scale.
The goal is usefulness.
