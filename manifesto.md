# Manifesto

Short, opinionated statements about how progress actually happens.

## On Launches

- Launches are experiments, not commitments
- A launch can be a conversation, a landing page, or showing one person a demo
- The goal is learning, not noise

## On Progress

- Progress requires exposure to reality
- Ideas need contact with actual users, not just more features
- Learning is the only real metric early on

## On Decisions

- Most products fail from bad sequencing, not bad ideas
- Clarity beats speed
- Judgment about what to do next matters more than tools

## On Building

- Knowing what not to build is as important as knowing what to build
- Restraint is a feature
- Overbuilding too early is a trap

## On Getting Unstuck

- The gap between "working prototype" and "clear next step" is where most builders stall
- Better to move slowly in the right direction than quickly in the wrong one
- What matters now is different from what matters later

If this resonates, you're in the right place. [Start here](/).
