# Decision Clarity for AI Builders

Most AI products don't fail because the tech is bad. They fail because the sequence of decisions is wrong.

If you've built something and now you're stuck—unsure what matters next, what to ignore, or where effort will actually compound—this site is for you.

## The Problem

You built it. It works. But now what?

The gap between "working prototype" and "clear next step" is where most builders stall. You can add features, polish the UI, or build more demos. But without judgment about what actually matters, you'll waste months on the wrong thing.

## The Approach

This site helps through real examples, opinionated analysis, and direct guidance. Not theory. Not hype. Just clarity about what to do next.

## Where to Start

### [Always Be Launching](/always-be-launching)

Real examples of builders who got stuck, the decisions that mattered, and what should happen next.

### [Advisory & Guidance](/advisory)

Direct help when you need judgment on your specific situation.

### [About](/about)

Why judgment matters and how I think about these problems.
