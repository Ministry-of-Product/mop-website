This isn't a résumé. It's a perspective statement.

## Why Judgment Matters

Most products fail from bad sequencing, not bad ideas. The difference between a working prototype and a product that matters comes down to judgment about what to do next, in what order, and what to ignore.

I've spent years working across product, data, and systems. The pattern I see repeatedly: builders get stuck not because they lack capability, but because they lack clarity about what decision actually matters right now.

## How I Think

- **Clarity beats speed** — Better to move slowly in the right direction than quickly in the wrong one
- **Progress requires exposure to reality** — Ideas need contact with actual users, not just more features
- **Learning is the only real metric early on** — Everything else is noise until you know what matters
- **Restraint is a feature** — Knowing what not to build is as important as knowing what to build

## What I Bring

Experience across product management, data systems, and building things that need to work in the real world. A bias toward plainspoken analysis over hype. Focus on decisions and tradeoffs, not tools and tactics.

If you've built something and you're stuck, [let's talk](/advisory).
