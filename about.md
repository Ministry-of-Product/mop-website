# About

Hi I'm Matt the principal consultant for Ministry of Product,

I’ve spent more than two decades building products, systems, and teams. Some of that work has been public. Much of the most valuable work hasn’t been. What matters is the pattern recognition that comes from long exposure to real constraints: budgets, people, incentives, messy data, shifting markets, and decisions that can’t be undone.

I work with business owners and senior leaders who don’t need hype — they need experience.

## Why Judgment Matters

The biggest risk in scaling with AI isn’t technical failure.

It’s bad sequencing.

Most companies don’t fail because they chose the wrong tools. They fail because they built the *wrong thing first*. They lock in assumptions too early. They scale noise instead of signal. They confuse experimentation with commitment.

After years of building and advising across product, data, and systems, the pattern is consistent: progress accelerates when leaders get clear about **which decision actually matters right now** — and deliberately ignore the rest.

That clarity compounds faster than any model or platform.

## What I Do

I help through **decision leadership with implementation credibility**.

That means I don’t advise from theory. I’ve built enough systems to know where plans break, where teams stall, and where second-order effects show up later.

Practically, this looks like:

- Helping identify which systems or capabilities are worth building first
- Pressure-testing AI ideas before they become expensive commitments
- Designing small, disciplined experiments that surface truth quickly
- Establishing clear success criteria so progress is measurable
- Helping leaders recognize when to double down — and when to stop

The goal isn’t more AI. The goal is **better decisions at scale**.

## How I Work

I optimize for long-term leverage, not short-term motion.

- **Clarity over speed** — Fast in the wrong direction is still wrong
- **Experiments over infrastructure** — Early systems earn permanence
- **Restraint over volume** — Saying no is often the highest ROI move
- **Judgment over tools** — Technology should amplify thinking, not replace it

I work closely with decision-makers as a thinking partner who can also build.


### What I Do

- Work with leaders who have real authority and real stakes
- Help sequence AI and product decisions intelligently
- Build or guide early implementations where learning speed matters
- Bring outside perspective grounded in lived experience
