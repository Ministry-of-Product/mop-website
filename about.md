# About

Hi, I’m Matt.
I run Ministry of Product.
I’ve spent the last couple of decades working alongside business owners and leadership teams, helping turn ideas into things that actually exist—products, systems, processes, and ways of working that hold up under real conditions.
Ministry of Product has been around for over ten years. Over that time, I’ve seen a wide range of situations: growing teams, limited budgets, shifting priorities, messy data, strong opinions, quiet doubts, and decisions that matter more than they first appear.
Some of that work has been visible. Much of it hasn’t. What stays with me isn’t the output—it’s the pattern recognition that comes from long exposure to how businesses really operate.

## How I think about this work

Most challenges around growth, technology, or AI aren’t actually technical.
They’re about timing, focus, and judgment.
Good tools used at the wrong moment tend to create friction.
Simple experiments, tried at the right time, tend to create clarity.

Over the years, I’ve noticed that progress usually accelerates when owners get clear about:
- what decision actually matters right now
- what can wait
- and what can safely be ignored for the moment

That clarity often does more for a business than any single system or platform.

## What I tend to help with

My role usually sits somewhere between thinking and doing.
I help business owners:
- sort through ideas without rushing to commit
- explore AI and software in grounded, practical ways
- try small experiments that reveal what’s useful
- notice where effort isn’t paying off
- make calmer decisions about what to build, change, or let go

Sometimes I build things.
Sometimes I sketch, test, or prototype.
Often, the most valuable work is simply creating the conditions for a better decision.

## How I like to work

I care about long-term ease, not short-term activity.
In practice, that usually means:
- moving carefully before moving quickly
- trying things before formalizing them
- keeping experiments small and understandable
- letting learning guide direction
- using technology to support thinking, not replace it

I work closely with decision-makers and owners, as a thinking partner who can also help make things real.

## A few boundaries that keep the work healthy

This work goes best when:
- there’s real ownership and responsibility
- decisions matter to someone
- learning is valued more than appearances
- progress is measured in usefulness, not volume

I’m most helpful when there’s room to think, try, reflect, and adjust.

## About you

People I work well with usually:
- run established businesses
- carry real responsibility
- feel the weight of decisions
- prefer clarity over novelty
- want fewer initiatives, not more
