# About

Hi, I’m Matt.
I run Ministry of Product.
I love businesses and technology. I’ve spent my career creating products and working alongside business owners and leadership teams. 
I created the Ministry of Product more than a decade ago to help business owners get an idea to market quickly. Over that time, I’ve seen a wide range of situations: growing teams, limited budgets, shifting priorities, messy data, strong opinions, quiet doubts, and decisions that matter more than they first appear.
Some of that work has been visible. Much of it hasn’t. What stays with me is the personal stories and lessons that come from how businesses really operate.

## How I think about this work

Most challenges around growth, technology, or AI aren’t actually technical.
They’re about communication, focus, and judgment.
I use product development to create clarity and to move the conversation forward.

Over the years, I’ve noticed that progress accelerates when owners can visualize ideas which in turns moves the conversation toward these questions :
- What decision actually matters right now?
- What can wait?
- What can safely be ignored for the moment?

That clarity often does more for a business than any single system or platform.

## What I tend to help with

My role usually sits somewhere between thinking and doing.
I help business owners:
- sort through ideas without rushing to commit
- explore AI and software in grounded, practical ways
- try small experiments that reveal what’s useful
- notice where effort isn’t paying off
- make calmer decisions about what to build, change, or let go

Sometimes I build things.
Sometimes I sketch, test, or prototype.
Often, the most valuable work is simply creating the conditions for a better decision.

## How I like to work

I care about long-term ease, not short-term activity.
In practice, that usually means:
- moving carefully before moving quickly
- trying things before formalizing them
- keeping experiments small and understandable
- letting learning guide direction
- using technology to support thinking, not replace it

I work closely with decision-makers and owners, as a thinking partner who can also help make things real.

## A few boundaries that keep the work healthy

This work goes best when:
- there’s real ownership and responsibility
- decisions matter to someone
- learning is valued more than appearances
- progress is measured in usefulness, not volume

I’m most helpful when there’s room to think, try, reflect, and adjust.

## About you

People I work well with usually:
- run established businesses
- carry real responsibility
- feel the weight of decisions
- prefer clarity over novelty
- want fewer initiatives, not more
