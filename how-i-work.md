# How I Work

## Approach

I help through decision leadership with implementation credibility. This means:

- **Clarity over speed** — Better to move slowly in the right direction than quickly in the wrong one
- **Experiments over commitments** — Early systems should be treated as experiments, not permanent infrastructure
- **Restraint over volume** — Saying no is often the highest-leverage move
- **Judgment over tools** — AI should scale judgment and strategy, not noise

The biggest risk isn't technical failure. It's bad sequencing.

## Boundaries

### What I Do

- Help identify which systems to build first, and in what order
- Provide decision frameworks for evaluating AI opportunities
- Build early experiments to test assumptions quickly
- Establish clear criteria for what success looks like
- Help recognize when to stop and try something else

### What I Don't Do

- Build production systems without clear success criteria
- Work on speculative projects without budget or authority
- Provide free consultations or demos
- Compete on price or speed
- Take on projects where the client isn't ready to make decisions

## Process

We start with a conversation about your situation, what you've tried, and where you're stuck. From there, we identify:

1. **The decision that matters** — What actually needs to be decided right now?
2. **The experiment** — What's the smallest thing we can build to test this?
3. **Success criteria** — How will we know if this is working?
4. **Next steps** — What happens after this experiment?

No long-term commitments. No vendor pitches. Just clarity about what to do next.

## Expectations

- **You have revenue, clients, and authority** — This isn't for idea-only founders
- **You're ready to make decisions** — Not just exploring possibilities
- **You have budget and decision-making authority** — Not shopping or tire-kicking
- **You value clarity over speed** — Not looking for quick fixes or hype

If this matches your situation, [let's talk](/advisory).
