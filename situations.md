# Situations I Help With

Each section describes a **decision scenario**, not an offering. These are the moments where sequencing matters most.

## You Have Revenue and Clients, But Growth Is Manual

You're successful, but scaling requires more people doing the same work. You know AI could automate parts of this, but you're not sure which parts to automate first—or whether automation is the right move at all.

The decision isn't "should we use AI?" It's "what should we scale first, and in what order?"

## You're Overwhelmed by AI Possibilities

Every tool promises transformation. Every consultant has a framework. You have the capability to build, but you're paralyzed by choice.

The decision isn't "which tool should we use?" It's "what experiment will teach us the most, fastest?"

## You've Built AI Systems That Don't Compound

You invested in AI infrastructure, but it's not delivering the leverage you expected. The systems work, but they're not moving the business forward.

The decision isn't "how do we fix this?" It's "what should we stop doing, and what should we build instead?"

## You Need to Scale Strategy, Not Just Operations

You're not just automating tasks. You're trying to scale judgment, insight, or decision-making. This requires different systems than operational automation.

The decision isn't "how do we automate more?" It's "how do we scale what actually matters?"

## You're Treating Experiments Like Commitments

You built something that works, but you're not sure if it's the right thing. You're afraid to stop because you've invested time and money, but you're also not seeing the results you need.

The decision isn't "how do we make this work?" It's "is this the right experiment, or should we try something else?"

## What This Is Not

This is not for:
- Idea-only founders without revenue or clients
- People afraid of ideas being "stolen"
- Vendor shoppers or tire-kickers
- Teams without budget or decision-making authority
- People looking for free work, demos, or speculative effort

If you're in one of these situations, [let's talk](/advisory).
